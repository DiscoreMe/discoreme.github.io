### About me
Initially, programming was a hobby for me. Now I try to create programs that make life easier for me or my friends (counting something, sorting, etc.). In addition, I like to read books on various subjects (recently more scientific). Every year the passion for programming increases, because when you work in real projects, you get a lot of incomprehensible information that you want to study. I like to study different branches of mathematics. In most cases, I like topics related to integrals, differentials, limits, logarithms and trigonometry.
